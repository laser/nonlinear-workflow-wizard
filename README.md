Nonlinear workflow/wizard using Backbone + Marionette

# What?

Inspired by an article on Derick Bailey's article "Modeling Explicit Workflow With Code, In JavaScript And Backbone Apps," I set forth in trying to develop a pattern for building wizards that could support both linear and non-linear workflows.

# How?

Basically, each step in the workflow, when invoked, is passed a callback that can be used as its "back" function.

# Notes

I didn't finish implementing all of the components used in this demo, but I don't think that takes away from anyone's ability to understand the pattern.
